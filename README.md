# Explainable KNN Recommender





This explainable artificial intelligence system based on the k nearest-neighbor algorithm, which can give a degree of recommendations and help people understand them through explanations. To test the hypothesis, a system was constructed that predicts the rating of an input movie through the user's rating history, and gives reasons that support and explain the predicted score. The explanations of predicted movie ratings are provided without sacrificing accuracy and performance of the k nearest-neighbor algorithm and aims to increase user understanding of the system and trust.
